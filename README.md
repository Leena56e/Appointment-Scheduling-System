Appointment-Scheduling-System
This project is a system that allows users (patients or clients) to view available time slots, book appointments, and receive reminders. It also supports appointment cancellations and rescheduling. The system can manage different service providers with their own schedules and availability. Additional features may include searching for providers, setting notifications, and generating appointment reports.

kills demonstrate:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Designing classes for users, appointments, service providers, and schedules.
Date and Time Handling: Using C++'s `ctime` or `chrono` libraries to manage appointments and reminders.
File Handling: Storing data like user info, appointments, and logs in text or CSV files for persistence.
User Interaction: Creating a user-friendly CLI or GUI to interact with the system.
